          <h2>Software fit for the future</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>During any modernisation project, technical improvements need to be prioritised according to business value. Learning from an initial project, eCW envisioned a multi-team, multi-stream software modernisation project to improve not only its productsâ€™ architecture and technical processes but would also allow it to continue innovating and evolving its systems for the next 10-years of growth.</p> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The Codurance team created a strategic continuous improvement program (CIP) that would help eCW senior leadership strategically prioritise improvement projects according to the business value. The CIP would be efficiently managed following agile methodologies, software craftsmanship principles and DevOps mindset. It would create a knowledge transfer through tasks, allowing a learn and apply approach and creating that new working culture within the organization.</p>

          <p>The CIP would create teams of eCW personnel working closely with experienced Codurance developers so they could begin to understand the new ways of working and a cultural shift that empowers the development of new skills. This led to the production of 6 strategic improvement projects in core business areas (4 led by Codurance, 2 by eCW with support from Codurance). As well as creating better ways of working being replicated across the organisation with a clear understanding of the ROI and reduction of accumulated technical debt.</p>
