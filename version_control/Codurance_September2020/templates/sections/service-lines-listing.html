Codurance was brought in to create a training program to upskill the developers with an in-person, hands-on approach. This training program took place in both India and the United States, it created excitement in a development approach that would allow consistency going forward.",

      "description" : "The EMR was initially created 20-years ago. Throughout its lifespan it had grown considerably and continuously been updated, meaning it now consisted of around 16 million lines of code. Each system within the EMR would need to be updated, creating safe areas to experiment and improve while establishing new ways of working. The system would need to continue to be live to support the thousands of eCW customers relying on its use, every day.",
