        <strong>
          Creating a multi-year software modernisation project
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        eCW recognised the need to modernise its systems and prepare the EMR platform for the next 10 years of rapid
        growth. In order to take this platform to the next level, it would need to upskill its delivery teams, and this
        would be the first area of improvement. The full modernization project would involve creating an effective
        software modernisation strategy which would address eCWâ€™s enterprise needs and lead to a full multi-year
        modernisation program.
